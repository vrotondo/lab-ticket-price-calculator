Ticket price calculator coded in Python.

Lab: Ticket Price Calculator 
In this lab, you will apply your knowledge of Python operators and control flow to create a practical ticket price calculator for a movie theater. This exercise will reinforce your understanding of conditional statements, user input handling, and basic program structure. By completing this lab, you'll gain hands-on experience in developing a real-world application of programming concepts.

Scenario
You are tasked with creating a ticket price calculator for a movie theater. The ticket price depends on the age of the customer and the type of movie (regular or premium). The pricing rules are as follows:

Children (age 12 and under): $8 for regular movies, $10 for premium movies
Adults (age 13-59): $12 for regular movies, $15 for premium movies
Seniors (age 60 and above): $10 for regular movies, $12 for premium movies
Requirements
Your Python program should:

Prompt the user to enter their age
Ask the user to specify the type of movie (regular or premium)
Calculate the ticket price based on the given rules
Display the calculated ticket price to the user
Tools and Resources
Python IDE
Visual Studio Code

Instructions
Step One: Set Up Your Development Environment
Open Visual Studio Code
Create a new Python file named ticket_calculator.py
Step Two: Plan Your Program
Identify the variables you'll need (e.g., age, movie_type, ticket_price)
Outline the structure of your if-elif-else statement
Step Three: Implement Your Solution
Write code to get user input for age and movie type
Implement the if-elif-else statement to determine the ticket price
Calculate and display the final ticket price
Step Four: Test Your Program 
Run your script multiple times with different inputs
Ensure it correctly calculates prices for all age groups and movie types
Verify that it handles invalid inputs appropriately
Step Five: Refine, Document, and Maintain
Add comments to explain your code's logic
Optimize your code if necessary
Ensure your variable names are descriptive and follow Python naming conventions
